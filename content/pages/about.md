Title: About this demo
Shorttitle: About

This is a demo site for the experimental Pelican Collection Builder system. The system consists of three building blocks:

1. A pelican plugin, [pelican-collection-builder](https://github.com/frederik-elwert/pelican-collection-builder), that dynamically generates pages from a CSV file and a folder with images,
2. a theme, [pelican-collection-theme](https://github.com/frederik-elwert/pelican-collection-theme), that displays them in a sensible manner, and
3. this template of how to bring the two together and configure them.
